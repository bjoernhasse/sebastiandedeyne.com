title: "Back at it! Process discovery & a newsletterroll"

Hi,

In the beginning of 2021 I decided to tone things down: low blogging activity, not too much open source follow-up, and most importantly a break from Twitter—which I [wrote about](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/twitter-break/). With so much to learn and keep up with, an occasional digital fast triggers a necessary reboot.

## Process discovery & communication: things I learned at an event storming workshop

Last month I attended an event storming workshop at [DDDEU](https://dddeurope.com/2021/). It was given by the creator of the method, Alberto Brandolini.

In short, [event storming](https://www.eventstorming.com) is a collection of methods to discover concepts and processes in a business. The main tool: Post-Its.

Since this was remote workshop, Post-Its were replaced by [Miro](http://miro.com), a realtime collaboration board.

Here are a few things I learned that reach beyond event storming.

**When you're trying to discover how something works, it's better to have something wrong on paper than having nothing.** You're going to make mistakes in the discovery process anyway. Having something on paper will make it explicit, and will ensure you keep track of it in other places even though when not perfect. [It is better to be prescriptive and wrong, than vague and right](https://blog.leanstack.com/it-is-better-to-be-prescriptive-and-wrong-than-vague-and-right/). If it's not there, it's not actionable.

**You can't validate something without a conversation.** I'm a proponent of async, written communication. Written communication ensures the writer has given something enough thought to write it down, and gives the reader time to think and process it in their own pace. However, written communication should often be reviewed together to validate it, as there's always more room for interpretation than both the writer and reader expect. Write, read, validate, improve.

**When you're stuck on a problem, try to solve it in reverse.** One of the exercises in the workshop was to create a timeline of the Cinderella story. Getting started is easy, but it gets harder as you approach the middle of the story. This is often the case, processes tend to be thicker in the middle. When you're stuck, tell the story in reverse. After that, it's easier to uncover the rest because you have gaps to fill.

## Newsletterroll

Like a blogroll, but for newsletters and harder on the tongue.

## On the horizon

Back to writing! Dive deeper into event storming. Maybe release my first stable PHP package in months (years?). Finally get a haircut since barber shops reopened. Continue reading Moby's memoir, Porcelain. Enjoy coffee brewed with the Chemex I got for my birthday. Go over budget buying records again.

Until the next issue,

Seb
